And a special thanks to the below contributors.
@JinIgarashi for his work on watergis United Nation Open GIS Initiative&amp;rsquo;s UN Vector Tile Toolkit to support us technically. Maintenance of Vectortiles data Actual vectortiles datas are owned by their water companies. Vectortiles data are located in following repositories.
narwassco/vt: Vectortiles for Narok Water, Kenya WASAC/vt: Vectortiles for WASAC, Rwanda nakuruwater/vt: Vectortiles for Nakuru Water, Kenya Thanks all of officers in the above water services providers to collect and maintain the GIS data.</description></item><item><title>Q&amp;A</title><link>https://docs.water-gis.com/en/questions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.water-gis.com/en/questions/</guid><description>1. How to change the size of pipe? This approach can&amp;rsquo;t allow you to edit any data through vector tiles. Vector tiles is static data, that is why it can provide you smooth access to map data. So you have to update the attributes of data from Desktop GIS software such as QGIS or ArcGIS.
2. How vector tiles can reduce NRW? Actually, there is still no good experience for reducing NRW.</description></item><item><title>Showcase</title><link>https://docs.water-gis.com/en/showcase/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.water-gis.com/en/showcase/</guid><description>The following websites are the final outputs of vector tiles maps for water sevices providers in both Kenya and Rwanda which are using this vector tiles toolkit.
You will see how this vectortiles is powerful for your water services providers.

Style file editor Mapbox Studio: You can upload mbtiles and edit your own style. it&amp;rsquo;s the best style editor although it can&amp;rsquo;t allow us to use third party sources. Maputnik Editor: You can edit your own style for any thirdparty vector tiles sources. Maptiler: You can upload mbtiles and edit your own style simply. However, you can combine to use Maptile and Maputnik Editor, it will be more flexible.</description></item></channel></rss>
