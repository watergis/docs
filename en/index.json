[{"uri":"https://water-gis.com/en/concept/","title":"Concept","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Chapter 1 1. Concept  To enable small organizations like water services provider to share and utilize their GIS data easily. To make operation \u0026amp; maintenance of vector tiles at the lowest cost as much as possible.  2. Why did I develop this tool? After collecting GIS data of water, most water services providers in Africa often failed to share and utilize the data because of limited budget and know-how. As a result, the GIS data will not be up-to-date at all. They will need to collect the same GIS data again after several years. It is not efficient actually.\nI have been looking for a way to keep their motivation to maintain the data continuously by having the water GIS data widely used through WebGIS. Recently, I became involved in a technology called vector tiles, then I developed this open source tool for water services providers.\n3. Benefit of using Vector Tiles in water services providers  To establish the effective way to share and utilize GIS data with all staffs after data collection To utilize GIS data more in order to make waterworks efficiency To use GIS data for all type of waterworks in utility (NOT ONLY for NRW and water distribution)  4. Current situation for utilizing GIS in water services providers GIS is very useful tool in order to make daily waterworks effective, and nowadays most of water utilities started to use GIS.\nHowever, there are some challenges usually:\n Very limited access to GIS data Requires high level skill of GIS for utilizing, it is quite difficult to use. It costs too much to procure GIS software and provide trainings Poor internet connection interrupt to share data via internet  In order to solve such as above situation, I recommend that you introduce vector tiles that can operate GIS data more sustainably and at low cost as open source and open data.\n5. Utilize Open Source \u0026amp; Open Data If we use open source software and make the data be at public domain, operational costs will be free of charge up to a certain usage. This makes it a good option for small oranizations which want to operate at a low cost.\n To use FOSS4G (Free \u0026amp; Open Source Software for Geospatial) software such as QGIS, PostGIS.  Significantly lower cost than proprietary products such as ArcGIS   Implement serverless by using Gihub Pages  Easy to implement because no GIS server is needed   To use WebGIS which has user friendly interface like Google Map  WebGIS does not need the advanced skills which is required for ArcGIS and QGIS. Minimize the cost of training by using WebGIS   To use vector tiles for data distribution  It is significantly lighter and less expensive to generate vector tiles than raster tiles such as WMS and TMS. More stable and faster than dynamic vector data distribution such as WFS.    6. Possibilities to utilize vector tiles in water services providers For instance, the following are possible uses:\n It can be effectively used as a measure against Non-Revenue Water (NRW). Plumbers can easily access vect tiles before constructing their waterworks to get a more efficient view of what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the field. Meter readers can use vector tiles in the field to more efficiently read meters. Customer care can use vector tiles when dealing with clients. It can lead to more appropriate responses and customer satisfaction. Manager can use vector tiles effectively for future planning of water networks, as well as for briefing and sharing with stakeholders like the Government and financial institubion. By making it open data, data can be shared with people outside the water sector. There are various possibilities and synergistic effects in the future, such as collaboration with private companies.  However, there are few examples of water supply data being used as open data at the moment. Therefore, how to utilize water supply vector tiles needs to be explored through trial and error.\nHow you utilize it is completely up to your organization!\n"},{"uri":"https://water-gis.com/en/setups/","title":"Setups","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Chapter 2 This chapter is going to explain what is required for vectortiles implementation, and how to host your vectortiles on Github pages as open data.\n Preparations for setuping vectortiles Installation of vectortiles Development of Terrain RGB for your app Installation of Valhalla API for your app  "},{"uri":"https://water-gis.com/en/setups/preparation/","title":"Preparations","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The following requirements must be implemented before developing vectortiles in your water services providers.\n"},{"uri":"https://water-gis.com/en/setups/preparation/install_postgis/","title":"Install PostgresSQL/PostGIS database","tags":[],"description":"","content":"This vectortiles toolkit uses PostgreSQL/PostGIS database.

But you can use the module directly in MacOS or Ubuntu machine. watergis/postgis2mbtiles-docker is the source code for Docker implementation.  First of all, you need to make SQL queries for each layer on config.js, so postgis2mbtiles tool will extract required data from PostGIS and a mbtiles will be created.\nBasic settings for a layer The below is a typical example to extract GeoJSON from PostGIS.\n{ name: \u0026#39;pipeline\u0026#39;, //specify your layer name  geojsonFileName: __dirname + \u0026#39;/pipeline.geojson\u0026#39;, //specify geojson name for temporary use  select: ` SELECT row_to_json(featurecollection) AS json FROM ( SELECT \u0026#39;FeatureCollection\u0026#39; AS type, array_to_json(array_agg(feature)) AS features FROM ( SELECT \u0026#39;Feature\u0026#39; AS type, ST_AsGeoJSON(ST_MakeValid(x.geom))::json AS geometry, row_to_json(( SELECT t FROM ( SELECT 14 as maxzoom, 11 as minzoom ) AS t )) AS tippecanoe, row_to_json(( SELECT p FROM ( SELECT x.pipe_id as fid, x.material, x.pipe_size, x.pressure, x.construction_year, x.rehabilitation_year, x.input_date ) AS p )) AS properties FROM pipeline x WHERE NOT ST_IsEmpty(x.geom) ) AS feature ) AS featurecollection ` } There is a special configuration for tippecanoe to set minimum zoom level and maximum zoom level.\nrow_to_json(( SELECT t FROM ( SELECT 14 as maxzoom, 11 as minzoom ) AS t )) AS tippecanoe, If your coordinates is not EPSG:4326(WGS84), you must transform your coordinate reference system by below SQL.\nST_TRANSFORM(geom,4326) Usecases Making your own SQLs for your database, this step is quite significant.

[narwassco/vt-map approach] A case of Narok Water, Kenya If your coverage area is small, you can use the approach of Narok Water to deploy. Please have a look following repository.\n narwassco/vt-map This module will use the following submodules to create Mapbox Vector Tile for deployment to gh-pages.  watergis/postgis2mbtiles: It creates mbtiles from PostGIS. watergis/mbtiles2pbf: It converts from mbtiles to pbf(mvt) tiles.    This module uses mapbox/tippecanoe for producing mbtiles. However, Narok water\u0026rsquo;s GIS computer is Windows 10 Pro, so it is not easy to run tippecanoe, I developed Docker to create Mapbox Vector Tile.\nii. [WASAC/vt approach] A case of WASAC, Rwanda (Recommended) If your coverage area is huge, I am afraid it is not easy to deploy thousands of vector tiles to Github pages. So you can use WASAC approach to deploy mbtiles first, then use Github Actions to extract vector tiles from your mbtiles. You can see the following repository for your reference.\n WASAC/vt This module will use the following submodules to create Mapbox Vector Tile for deployment to gh-pages.  watergis/postgis2mbtiles: It creates mbtiles from PostGIS. postgis2mbtiles module will run on your local computer. watergis/mbtiles2pbf: It converts from mbtiles to pbf(mvt) tiles. mbtiles2pbf will run on Github Actions.    The below is a workflow file of Narok Water to automate deploy pbf files from mbtiles by Github Actions.\nname: Node.js CI on: push: branches: [ master ] jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Use Node.js uses: actions/setup-node@v1 with: node-version: 12.x - run: npm ci env: NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}} - run: npm run extract - name: configure git and deploy env: NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}} run: |git config --global user.name \u0026#34;narwassco+githubci\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;narwassco+githubci@users.noreply.github.com\u0026#34; git remote set-url origin https://x-access-token:${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}@github.com/narwassco/vt.git npm run deploy   Narok Water also started using [WASAC/vt approach] instead [narwassco/vt-map approach].\n narwassco/vt    Nakuru Water also started using [WASAC/vt approach].\n nakuruwater/vt    In case data size exceeds more than capacity of Github Pages Github Pages has limitation of usage maximum 1GB storage. If your data exceeds that limit, it is not possible to deploy to gh-pages.\nHowever, you may have another option to use Netlify.\nIn Rwanda, we wanted to include parcels data as base map. Parcels in the whole Rwanda is originally 8GB in shapefile. After converting to pbf vector tiles, total size of tiles became 1.2GB. But we successfully managed to deploy parcels by usign Netlify.\nYou can have a look the below repository how we deployed huge vector tiles to Netlify.\n WASAC/vt-parcels-2020: Letest parcels as of 21 July 2020 WASAC/vt-parcels: Old parcels vector tiles before 2019(we are not sure exact surveyed date)  Because parcels data is huge, we could not extract GeoJSON from PostGIS and to use tippecanoe. Thus in this case, we directly extract pbf tiles from PostGIS by using watergis/mvt-generator module. It is quite different approach from what vt repository do.\n"},{"uri":"https://water-gis.com/en/setups/installation/deploy_stylefile_sprite/","title":"Deploy Mapbox Stylefiles and Sprite files to gh-pages","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Deploy Mapbox Stylefiles and Sprite files on gh-pages   watergis/sprite-creater : This module will assist you to create sprite files from your icons.\n  Please create a repository which can be named mapbox-stylefiles.

In Narok water, although we have a pumping station at the WTP, we don\u0026rsquo;t have layer for pump. I know it is significant for a water company. So, you may need to add a layer for pumping station.\n3.

In Rwanda and Kenya, we are using UNVT as one of base maps which is completeley license free\u0026rsquo;s map generated from Open Street Map.\nIf you are suffering for the payment for Google Map, Mapbox, Maptiler or any other map services providers, UNVT would be the great tool for your organization.\nHosting UNVT map for a country on Github pages UNVT is mainly designed for operating on Raspberry Pi, however it can be hosted on Github pages to distribute OSM based vactor tiles. It can produce vector tiles very fast and lightly.\nFor hosting on Github pages, you can use unvt/naru respository.\nHere, I introduce how to generate by using Docker.\n1. Fork unvt/naru Firstly, you can fork unvt/naru on your Github.\n2. Setup Firstly, you can install Docker and docker-compose on your computer either Windows, MacOS or Linux. See the instruction here.\nThen, you can download the source code from Github, and build Docker image.\ngit clone https://github.com/{your organization name}/naru.git cd naru docker build . --tag unvt/naru 3. Generate vector tiles cd naru docker run -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app -p 9966:9966 -it unvt/naru # now you entered into Docker container cd /usr/src/app cp .env.example .env vi .env # edit environmental variable Here, we are going to generate UNVT map for Rwanda in Easern Africa. You can confirm the region and area on Geofabrik.\nThe below is an example of .env.\nREGION=africa AREA=rwanda SITE_ROOT=http://localhost:9966 Now, you execute the following commands to generate each components for vector tiles map.\nrake inet:download # download osm.pbf rake inet:mbgljs # download mapbox-gl-js package rake js # rollup javascript code rake inet:sprite # download maki and build sprite rake inet:fonts # download fonts and create glyphs rake tiles # create mbtiles under src folder rake style # create style.json After running the above commands, all of resources will be created under docs folder. docs folder is normally used for Github pages public directory.\nthe structure of docs directory should be as below.\n docs  glyphs js  bundle.js bundle.js.map mapbox-gl.css mapbox-gl.js   sprite  sprite.json sprite.png sprite@2x.json sprite@2x.png sprite@4x.json sprite@4x.png   zxy glyphs.json index.html style.json    Now you can ready to check your map on local browser!\nJust run the below command to host tiles by budo.\nrake host open http://localhost:9966 on your browser to check your UNVT map.\n4. Uploading tiles to Github If your UNVT map\u0026rsquo;s everything is okay, you can now upload it to Github for publishing.\ngit add docs -f # we use -f option to force to commit all documents git commit -m \u0026#34;generated vectortiles\u0026#34; git push origin master 5. Make docs folder publish as Github pages Go to settings of your naru repository page, then you can find Github Pages section on Options tab. You can configure github pages there.\nPlease also see more detailed information on their public website here.\nAfter publishing as Github pages, you can access your UNVT map from the URL like https://{your organization}.github.io/naru.\nAlso, you can access your all components of map as following.\n Vector Tiles  https://{your organization}.github.io/naru/zxy/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf  Sprite file  https://{your organization}.github.io/naru/sprite/sprite  Glyphs  https://{your organization}.github.io/naru/glyphs/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf Advanced development a. Interageration Natural Earth Map for low scale zoom levels 0 - 5 UNVT\u0026rsquo;s OSM map only generate zoom level 6 to 15. If you need low scale map, you can add Natural Earth based UNVT.\nIn order to add Natural Earth Map, you need to modify Rakefile in your repository.\n rake inet:download section  desc \u0026#39;download source geospatial data to the place\u0026#39; task :download do if !File.exist?(\u0026#34;src/#{AREA}-latest.osm.pbf\u0026#34;) u = \u0026#34;https://download.geofabrik.de/#{REGION}/{#{AREA}-latest.osm.pbf}\u0026#34; sh \u0026#34;curl -C - #{u}--output \u0026#39;./src/#1\u0026#39;\u0026#34; end # add the below command. if !File.exist?(\u0026#34;src/ne_tiles.mbtiles\u0026#34;) u = \u0026#34;https://watergis.github.io/unvt-ne/{ne_tiles.mbtiles}\u0026#34; sh \u0026#34;curl -C - #{u}--output \u0026#39;./src/#1\u0026#39;\u0026#34; end end  rake tiles section  desc \u0026#39;build tiles from source data\u0026#39; task :tiles do sh \u0026#34;osmium export --config osmium-export-config.json --index-type=sparse_file_array --output-format=geojsonseq --output=- src/#{AREA}-latest.osm.pbf | node filter.js | tippecanoe --no-feature-limit --no-tile-size-limit --force --simplification=2 --maximum-zoom=15 --base-zoom=15 --hilbert --output=#{MBTILES}\u0026#34; # You need to tile-join tiles.mbtiles and ne_tiles.mbtiles sh \u0026#34;tile-join --force --no-tile-compression --output-to-directory=docs/zxy --no-tile-size-limit #{MBTILES}src/ne_tiles.mbtiles\u0026#34; end  add style for Natural Earth layers You need to add style for additional natural earth layers. You can use the style from this repository. I indicated the file name start with ne- as Natural Earth layers.  If you think it is difficult, just simply copy hocon folder from WASAC/naru repository.\nb.

Vector tiles make huge maps fast while offering full design flexibility. They are the vector data equivalent of image tiles for web mapping, applying the strengths of tiling — developed for caching, scaling and serving map imagery rapidly — to vector data. (from Mapbox website).\n Vector Tiles is the most popular and advanced mapping technology currently, its data is very light and fast, offering full design flexibility.\nIts operation cost is normally cheaper compare to raster tiles data distribution.\nIn Africa, Internet connection is still poor in some rural area. Vector Tiles is right solution for such as poor internet situation. You can enjoy browsing smoothly in your computer or smartphones.\nOur vector tiles approach uses Github pages without servers. I know it is quite difficult for some of water services providers to have servers in Africa. This tools were developed for you!\nCase Studies See our case studies of actual water services providers in Africa from Case Studies.\nContribution to this Open Source Project This vectortiles tools were developed and are maintained by Jin IGARASHI.\nPlease let me know through Github\u0026rsquo;s issues or pull request if you have any feedbacks. Also, if you like my GIS works for water services providers in Africa, please support this project through Github Sponsor.\n"},{"uri":"https://water-gis.com/en/questions/","title":"Q&amp;A","tags":[],"description":"","content":"1. How to change the size of pipe? This approach can\u0026rsquo;t allow you to edit any data through vector tiles. Vector tiles is static data, that is why it can provide you smooth access to map data. So you have to update the attributes of data from Desktop GIS software such as QGIS or ArcGIS.\n 2. How vector tiles can reduce NRW? Actually, there is still no good experience for reducing NRW. However, if we can share the GIS data widely with all of colleagues, I think it will help water utility manage NRW more efficient.\nBy the way, I am also trying to add new function to integrate EPANET on this WebGIS application. If you can see the result of EPANET simulation, it will be so helpful.\n 3. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that I understood well about vector tiles. To create vector tile data, the source data on pipelines should be existed in some database form? Yes, your GIS data must be stored in certain GIS database. It creates vector tiles tilesets directly from GIS database. This approach uses PostgreSQL/PostGIS because its database is open source. However, you can modify the source code for other database if you are using SQL Server, Oracle and others.\n 4. Does it work offline? Can people view it once they download in the mobile phone or PC? (Like maps.me) Unfortunately, this is online web application, so you can\u0026rsquo;t see offline. However, you can download mbtiles tilesets to your Android devices, so offline viewing can be available by using QField or INPUT app.\n 5. How can this vector tiles be used in case of water distribution network development projects? In Rwanda, we includes some statistics information in vector tiles. So, all of staffs can see any required information for planning water facilities. It can be used for future developments.\n 6. What is the main advantage of Vector Tile over QGIS? Most of water utilities' GIS administrator actually asked me about editing funcitons. However, WebGIS includes editing is normally extremely expensive. This approach delegated all of editing functions to QGIS side. So, the graphical user interface become very simple and easy to use by other people. You can save a lot of development and training costs.\n 7. To open the data to everybody have some troubles in praivacy. How do you solve this problem? That is true, if you open some data to public, it will be dangerous sometimes. So you must consider which types of data can be published as open data. In Rwanda\u0026rsquo;s case, we deleted all of privacy information such as client name. In Narok water\u0026rsquo;s case, we deleted searching funciton by client name because of security issue. When you design your own vector tiles, first you should discuss which types of data you can publish.\n 8. Is google maps used as the base map? No, you can\u0026rsquo;t use Google Maps as base map. Because Google Maps has very restricted license and normally very expensive to use. However, we can use open street map based map which are provided by Mapbox, MapTiler or United Nation Vector Tiles. Also, you can overlay your own base map data on OSM. For instance, in Rwanda and Kenya, we added parcels data of Land Authority on OSM map. It will help most of water utilities especially when they connect new houlsehold meters.\n"},{"uri":"https://water-gis.com/en/showcase/","title":"Showcase","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The following websites are the final outputs of vector tiles maps for water sevices providers in both Kenya and Rwanda which are using this vector tiles toolkit.\nYou will see how this vectortiles is powerful for your water services providers.\n Narok Water, KENYA WASAC RWSS, RWANDA Nakuru Water, KENYA Nanyuki Water, KENYA  "},{"uri":"https://water-gis.com/en/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://water-gis.com/en/tools/","title":"Thirdparty Tools","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The following tools are maybe useful for your implementation of vector tiles\nStyle file editor  Mapbox Studio: You can upload mbtiles and edit your own style. it\u0026rsquo;s the best style editor although it can\u0026rsquo;t allow us to use third party sources.
