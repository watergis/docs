This toolkit uses `Docker` to generate vectortiles from PostGIS database in order to use `tippecanoe` tool. So, please install `Docker` in your computer.

#### Docker Desktop on Windows
See [official webpage](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) to install it.

- Please make sure you selected `Linux container`(`Windows container` is incorrect!)
- Please enable your Hyper-V in your computer.

#### Docker Desktop on MacOS
See [official webpage](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) to install it by `Homebrew`.

```bash
brew search docker
brew cask install docker
```

#### Docker on Ubuntu
See [official webpage](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) to install it.

However, if it is Linux, you don't actually need to install Docker. You can directly install `tippecanoe` on ubuntu to use these tools.
