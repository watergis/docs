# Vector Tiles for Water Management

This webiste is to show you our awesome implementations of the Mapbox Vector Tiles for Water Services Providers.

Also, we will guide you how to implement vector tiles and to share GIS data in your water services providers.

## What is Vector Tiles?

> Vector tiles make huge maps fast while offering full design flexibility. They are the vector data equivalent of image tiles for web mapping, applying the strengths of tiling — developed for caching, scaling and serving map imagery rapidly — to vector data. (from [Mapbox website](https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/reference/)).

**Vector Tiles** is the most popular and advanced mapping technology currently, its data is very light and fast, offering full design flexibility. 

Its operation cost is normally cheaper compare to raster tiles data distribution.

In Africa, Internet connection is still poor in some rural area. **Vector Tiles** is right solution for such as poor internet situation. You can enjoy browsing smoothly in your computer or smartphones.

Our vector tiles approach uses Github pages without servers. I know it is quite difficult for some of water services providers to have servers in Africa. This tools were developed for you!

## Case Studies
See our case studies of actual water services providers in Africa from [Case Studies](./casestudies).

## Contribution to this Open Source Project
This vectortiles tools were developed and are maintained by [Jin IGARASHI](https://jin-igarashi.me/en). 

Please let me know through Github's issues or pull request if you have any feedbacks. Also, if you like my GIS works for water services providers in Africa, please support this project through [Github Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/JinIgarashi).
