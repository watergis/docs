# Vectortile Toolkits for Water Management

This is awesome implementations of the Mapbox Vector Tile for Water Services Providers.

## Why Vectortiles?

> Vector tiles make huge maps fast while offering full design flexibility. They are the vector data equivalent of image tiles for web mapping, applying the strengths of tiling — developed for caching, scaling and serving map imagery rapidly — to vector data. (from [Mapbox website](https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/reference/)).

`Vectortiles` is the most popular and advanced mapping technology currently, its data is very light and fast, offering full design flexibility. 

Its operation cost is normally cheaper compare to raster tiles data distribution.

In Africa, Internet connection is still poor in some rural area. This vectortiles is right solution for such as poor internet situation. You can enjoy browsing smoothly in your computer or smartphones.

Our vectortiles approach uses Github pages without servers. I know it is quite difficult for some of water services providers to have servers in Africa. This toolkits were developed for you!

## Steps for implementation of Vectortiles

1. [Requirements before setup](./contents/requirements.md)

2. [How to generate vector tiles](./contents/how-to-generate-vectortiles.md)

3. [Cost of Operation & Maintenance for Vectortiles](./contents/costs.md)

## Overview map
I developed an [overview map](https://watergis.github.io/water-map) for to manage all of vectortiles of water supply system. You can zoom the map and tap any point, so you can see more detailed water supply network data from the link of popup.

## Contribute to this documentation
This vectortiles toolkit was developed and is maintained by Jin IGARASHI(see [portfolio](https://water-gis.com) if you are fascinated by more details about me). If you have any feedbacks, please let me know through Github's issues or pull request. Also, if you like my GIS works for water services providers in Africa, you can make donation through [Github Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/JinIgarashi).
